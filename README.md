# passwordgen
Password generator inspired by Gfycat URLs and xkcd

---

This script uses `adjectives.txt` and `nouns.txt` to build a randomly-generated base password of Adjective1Noun1Adjective2Noun2. It also uses the `appJar` library to display a GUI.

The password can be modified to have up to 3 numbers and up to 3 symbols added, as well as having random capitalization.
